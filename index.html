    <h1>Privacy Policy for Browser Buddy</h1>

    <p>At Browser Buddy, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy outlines the types of information we collect and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Our extension captures screenshots of the current browser tab every two seconds. These screenshots are only sent to our system when you ask a question and are immediately discarded afterward. No screenshots are stored or shared.</p>
    <p><strong>Email Address (Optional):</strong> If you choose to provide feedback via our Google Form, we collect your email address solely to respond to your inquiry. This is entirely optional, and your email will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Screenshots are used solely to provide relevant responses to your questions based on the content of the active browser tab. Once the interaction is completed, the screenshot is deleted.</p>
    <p><strong>Email Address:</strong> Your email address, if submitted, is used only to respond to your feedback or questions. It is not shared with any third parties or used for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your screenshots, email addresses, or any other data with third parties except when required by law or for security purposes (e.g., investigating abuse).</p>

    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <p>All data transmitted (such as screenshots and email addresses) is encrypted and handled securely. We do not store any screenshots after the interaction ends, and email addresses are stored securely in compliance with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about your data, or if you would like to request that we delete any email you submitted, please contact us at <a href="mailto:[valle_omar@yahoo.com]">[valle_omar@yahoo.com]</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please review this page regularly for any updates. Your continued use of the extension constitutes your acceptance of any changes to this policy.</p>
